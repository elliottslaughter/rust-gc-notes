* 2012-06-19: Notes to self
** FastISel
*** Rust doesn't call SelectionDAG or FastISel directly, but through an LLVM pass.
*** Some function is responsible for setting up the instruction selector (addISelToPass or somesuch).
*** Need to add fast-isel-abort parameter to this pass so the FastISel knows not to fall back to SelectionDAG.
*** Rust compilation happens in three phases:
**** Stage 0: Download binary from server.
**** Stage 1: Compile rustc with binary.
**** Stage 2: Compile rustc with itself.
**** Stage 3: Compile rustc with itself again to check stability.
*** If you swap in FastISel, then you might only be able to get through stage 1 (i.e. rustc might not be able to compile itself), but you should be able to still try some simple testcases.
*** See how many testcases you can do, then switch over to other stuff.
** Roadmap (as far as I can remember)
*** ISel
**** FastISel and fast-isel-abort
**** Merge work on FastISel
**** Finish work on SelectionDAG
*** Unwinding
*** ???
