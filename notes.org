** Notes to self
*** Rust doesn't call SelectionDAG or FastISel directly, but through an LLVM pass.
*** Some function is responsible for setting up the instruction selector (addISelToPass or somesuch).
*** Need to add fast-isel-abort parameter to this pass so the FastISel knows not to fall back to SelectionDAG.
