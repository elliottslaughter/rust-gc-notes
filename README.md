# Rust Precise GC Implementation Notes

These are my notes from implementing precise GC for Rust at Mozilla
Research during my internship over the summer of 2012. An overview of
my work follows in the rest of this file.

I also kept a detailed log of my day-to-day activities. While I do not
expect it to be especially useful to anyone, it may serve to answer
specific questions about what configurations I was running, etc. The
detailed log can be found at the link below.
